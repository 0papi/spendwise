This is a personal finance tracking application.

# main items

- Splashscreen
- Dashboard
- Settings
- Expense History
- Auth

# Dashboard

On the dashboard screen, I would love to see the following:

- a card showing the total income
- another card displaying total expense
- another card showing balance
- another card showing the savings
- another card showing investment
- some charts to visualize and also show details for each item: that is if we are viewing total expenses for instance, then we have the items with the most total expenses
- and perhaps a table showing the latest transactions

# Settings

On the settings screen, I want to be able to:

- configure certain aspects of my application such as setting budgets for the year or month depending on whichever is used to show the fields on the dashboard
- Updating my profile information

# History

On the history screen, I want to see:

- incomings
- outgoings
  I should be able to view details for each of these transactions
